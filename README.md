Hi everyone!
I’m Andrea Lepori and currently I'm a master computer science student at Università of Pisa.
Computer Science's subject I'm most curious about are Artificial Intelligence in all its facets, but I'm also interested in IoT and in more maths-related subjects. 
Here you can find mostly some of the code I've written for my university projects or other software stuff
